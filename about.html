            <p class="intro">
                Hi, I'm Taraaa! I'm a passionate developer with a love for creating
                innovative solutions. My journey in tech began with curiosity and has evolved
                into a deep-seated passion for coding, design, and problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p class="details">
                I specialize in web development, particularly with technologies like
                Python and Django. I enjoy building projects that are not only functional but 
                also aesthetically pleasing. My goal is to continuously grow as a developer 
                and contribute to projects that make a difference.
            </p>
            <p class="details">
                In addition to my coding skills, I'm also proficient in Illustrator and Photoshop. 
                I enjoy working on design projects where I can combine my technical and creative skills 
                to produce visually appealing graphics and layouts. Whether it's web development or 
                digital art, I strive to create work that stands out.
            </p>
            <p class="details">
                When I'm not coding or designing, you can find me exploring new places, reading 
                books on technology and design, or indulging in some creative pursuits. I'm always 
                eager to learn new skills and collaborate with like-minded individuals.
